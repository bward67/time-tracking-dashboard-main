This was a huge challenge for me. I first inserted the images on the cards as background images and placed them in the correct places BUT then when it came to the JS and I was appending a new section for the cards I realised I must insert them in my HTML rather than in my CSS. I had also used Flexbox on the cards but had to change them to Grid as it worked so much better when switching to a larger screen size.

The JS was an enormous challenge and so I eventually watched a youtube video from Seer Studio and it was really good - I learned sooooo much! Thank you Seer Studio - you should make more videos!. This is the link to Seer Studio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9Qw8y3LfCY

In the end it is not absolutely perfect as there is a very slight colored outline around the cards but maybe I will awake up in the middle of the night some time soon with the solution on how to fix it :) - ahh come on - we've all done that!!
